# Bike-Sharing---Multiple-Linear-Regression
Handled Missing values& redundant variablesand executed Exploratory Data Analysisand Data Preprocessingusing using One Hot Encodingto handle categorical features and Feature Scalingto normalize the data
Eliminated  weakest  features  using Recursive  Feature  Eliminationand  fitted Multiple  Linear  modelby  Backward elimination of the remaining features (VIF & p-value approach) on the training data
Checkedthe  assumptions  of Linearity,  Multicollinearity,  Normality,  Autocorrelation  and  Homoscedasticityusing Rainbow test, Q-Q plot, VIF,Residual vs Fitted plot, Durbin Watson test, etc. and appliedthe model ontest data
Achieved adjustedR2 = 0.799on test data and validated the results using Cross validation technique
